## üöÄ From Days to Minutes: Fast-Track Code Understanding

**Vxplain** transforms how developers understand codebases. This powerful VS Code extension reduces onboarding time from days to minutes by automatically generating visual representations of your code architecture and logic flows.

Built for professional developers working with complex projects, Vxplain eliminates guesswork and accelerates comprehension through intuitive visualizations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Architecture Diagrams
Generate high-level design diagrams of your codebase architecture automatically, providing instant understanding of system components and their relationships.

### Interactive Call Graphs
- Visualize relationships between functions, classes, and modules
- Single-click to isolate connections for focused analysis
- Double-click to navigate directly to source implementation
- Export high-quality graphs for documentation and presentations

### Directory Tree Visualization
Instantly see your project's complete file structure in one organized view, making navigation effortless and intuitive.

### Code-to-Diagram Generation
Convert code snippets into visual diagrams to quickly understand control flow, structure, and business logic without manual diagramming.

### Multi-level Summaries
Generate tailored abstractions of your codebase for every stakeholder, from architecture overviews to detailed function flowcharts.

### Team Sharing
Share your visualizations across the team and copy diagrams directly to your codebase, making knowledge accessible to all team members.

### Bring Your Own LLMs
We support custom LLM providers, allowing you to use the tools you already have while maintaining control of your data.

## üåü Professional Use Cases
