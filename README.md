# ‚ùì FAQ

## Can I disable AI features?

Yes, you can disable AI features. However, this will disable architecture diagrams, summaries, code-to-diagram generation. Only function call graph and directory tree visualization will work. If that's what you need, you can update `Vxplain: Enable Ai Features` to `false` in the settings.

> If disabled, you won't need any active internet connection to use the extension. Everything happens locally.

## What configuration options are available?

Right now, configuration options are limited. We are working on it.
We will bring support to exclude the files and folders from analysis, control depth of analysis, and more.

## What usage data is collected? Can I disable it?

Yes, you can disable analytics. If you disable analytics, we will not collect any data at all. Which means, even the crash reports will not be collected and you will have to manually send them to us.

We collect usage data which is needed to improve vxplain experience, such as clicks, error logs, performance metrics, session replays and similar metrics. We never collect any source code, file contents, or any other sensitive data.

## Will this be open source?

We are still in early stages of development and eventurally, either all or some parts of the code will be open source.
